# StartHere

The goal to enter a career in Cybersecurity, Linux Systems Administration, Cloud DevOps or a Networking Engineer is just like anything else. You get out what you put in as far as effort. 

If you spend no real time on your prospective career option, do not expect any genuine returns.

These repositories are for the hustler. The self-starter who does not need their hand-held to make changes in their lives.

There are two factions of humans and classifications in between on this Earth:
The Introvert
The Extrovert
Humans who exist somewhere in between both extremes.

Becoming a Dream takes work, time, dedication, discipline and energy. Nothing worth anything comes cheap or free and many times will never be easy.

Peace Be Unto You!
